# Breaking Registration

## Context

This is my final project for my Applied Internet Technologies/Web Development class. The website is complete to the final project specifications, though not complete functionally. I was going to continue this project for use for my break dance club, but after I found that we wouldn't need it, I dropped it to work on other projects.

## Vision

I'm a break dancer (known in the scene as a "bboy" or "breaker") and I've begun getting more involved with the community. As of late, there have been a few leagues pop up (most notably "UDEF"), where breakers can register and enter events (called "jams" within the community). However, their site is essentially exclusively for event registration and sign ups, and I felt that there could be much more. 

I saw potential value in using this website to track breakers, what events they've been to, their number of wins, etc. If enough breakers used this website, it could also become a sort of leaderboard or ladder common in many eSports for example (another passion of mine). 

On the flip side, events can more easily track attendence, and look at past events for guidance. 

## User Stories

1. As a user I can register on this site, and use that registration to sign up for events
2. As a user I can search for other bboys by varying criteria, including region, number of wins, etc
3. As a user I can search for events by region, prize money, format, etc.
4. As a user I can easily see which breakers are in which crews (and vice versa)
5. As a user I can register a new event. 
6. As a user I can register my crew and have my crewmates join them.
